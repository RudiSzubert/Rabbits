COMMIT MESSAGES FORMAT:
Why?
allow generating CHANGELOG.md by script
allow ignoring commits by git bisect (not important commits like formatting, style)
provide better information when browsing the history of commits

Commit message format:
A commit message consists of a header, body (optional) and footer (optional). 
The header has a type, scope (optional) and subject in imperative:

<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>


The header is mandatory, example below of required entry format:

<type>(): <subject>

Types:
feat (new feature)
fix (bug fix)
docs (changes to documentation)
style (formatting, missing semicolons, etc; no code change)
refactor (refactoring of production code - that not relates directly to feature or fix)
test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change, other things)

As main types we propose FEAT, FIX and CHORE, others are up to you for usage.
